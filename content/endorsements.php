			<p class="endorsement-quote">"Some call this generation "the fatherless generation." And rightly so. If not orphaned, countless children are functionally fatherless. Abuse, abandonment, and neglect are all too familiar experiences for today's youth. These experiences are devastating. But there's hope. Jonathan points us to the fountain of hope and love in <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>. By taking truth to struggle, Jonathan shows us that Jesus's grace sufficiently strengthens, sustains, and satisfies the believer in the midst of his or her grief and hardship."</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">"Concussed by his dad’s leaving, Edwards narrates the particular, detailed miseries that he experienced as a boy, a teen, and an adult. But there is a turning, and his mother’s love points him to the One who can heal, forgive and fill. To read this is to grieve, but also to marvel anew at the Redeemer."</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">"In <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> my friend Jonathan Edwards provides a biblically-informed, heartfelt, and pastoral book about the existential realities of divorce. Highly recommended."</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">"When you open the pages of <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>, you peer into the heart of anyone who has ever been abandoned by a parent. With raw emotion and haunting honesty, Jonathan Edwards poignantly pens of the lingering longing and gnawing ache that occurs when a parent leaves, and leads the reader to a place of healing and hope. If you have been left by a parent, you will see yourself in Jonathan’s words and know that you are not alone. If you have a loved-one that is struggling with being left as a child, you will have a better understanding of the heart wounded by parental abandonment."</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">"From the very first page of <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> I was struck by the importance of this book. How many millions of kids have tried to make sense of their feelings of abandonment? Edwards takes the reader through the raw agony of rejection, the searing pain of loss and the brokenhearted emotions of a boy deprived of a father.  Yet, he has made a startling and redemptive move in writing this book.  Rather than wallow around assigning blame, Jonathan works through the tragedy until he finds the peace of Jesus Christ.  Forgiveness and healing find their way into his story and at the end he offers hope and a future to all those who still fight to keep their heads above water, never quite able to let go of their hurt or be rid of the nagging question, “What if…”. Everyone knows someone who needs to read this."</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">"<strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> is a raw and riveting series of reflections on life in the wake of parental abandonment. Those who have been through similar circumstances will find in Jonathan an articulate voice for this particular pain. Those who have not been through this experience will find a window into how best to minister and serve their friends from broken families."</p>
