			<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;Some call this generation &#8216;the fatherless generation&#8217;" And rightly so. If not orphaned, countless children are functionally fatherless. Abuse, abandonment, and neglect are all too familiar experiences for today's youth. These experiences are devastating. But there's hope. Jonathan points us to the fountain of hope and love in <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>. By taking truth to struggle, Jonathan shows us that Jesus's grace sufficiently strengthens, sustains, and satisfies the believer in the midst of his or her grief and hardship.&#8221;</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;Concussed by his dad’s leaving, Edwards narrates the particular, detailed miseries that he experienced as a boy, a teen, and an adult. But there is a turning, and his mother’s love points him to the One who can heal, forgive and fill. To read this is to grieve, but also to marvel anew at the Redeemer.&#8221;</p>

			<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;In <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> my friend Jonathan Edwards provides a biblically-informed, heartfelt, and pastoral book about the existential realities of divorce. Highly recommended.&#8221;</p>

				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;When you open the pages of <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>, you peer into the heart of anyone who has ever been abandoned by a parent. With raw emotion and haunting honesty, Jonathan Edwards poignantly pens of the lingering longing and gnawing ache that occurs when a parent leaves, and leads the reader to a place of healing and hope. If you have been left by a parent, you will see yourself in Jonathan’s words and know that you are not alone. If you have a loved-one that is struggling with being left as a child, you will have a better understanding of the heart wounded by parental abandonment.&#8221;</p>

				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;From the very first page of <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> I was struck by the importance of this book. How many millions of kids have tried to make sense of their feelings of abandonment? Edwards takes the reader through the raw agony of rejection, the searing pain of loss and the brokenhearted emotions of a boy deprived of a father.  Yet, he has made a startling and redemptive move in writing this book.  Rather than wallow around assigning blame, Jonathan works through the tragedy until he finds the peace of Jesus Christ.  Forgiveness and healing find their way into his story and at the end he offers hope and a future to all those who still fight to keep their heads above water, never quite able to let go of their hurt or be rid of the nagging question, “What if…”. Everyone knows someone who needs to read this.&#8221;</p>

				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;<strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> is a raw and riveting series of reflections on life in the wake of parental abandonment. Those who have been through similar circumstances will find in Jonathan an articulate voice for this particular pain. Those who have not been through this experience will find a window into how best to minister and serve their friends from broken families.&#8221;</p>

				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;If a father could read this, he would nail his shoes to the floor. <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> puts words to the experience and feelings of everyone who has lost a parent. Simply put, what Edwards says is so raw and so real, you will wonder how God could ever, ever heal a father-shaped hole in anyone's heart.  But He can and He does. If losing a parent is part of your story, you will be so grateful for this book.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="endorsement">
				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;Some stories inform. Others transform. Jonathan Edwards weaves a story that opens eyes to the dark world of kids left behind by abandoning parents. The winsome, well-written story telling in <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> is much needed in the Christian community; for while Edwards exposes the seeming hopelessness of some divorces, he does not leave the reader in that state of hopelessness. Instead, he offers a way out, a way up. He offers the same hope to his readers that he has found himself in Jesus. He is empathetic. As the husband of a wonderful woman who was left by her own father, I have lived his story by proxy. As a Christian theologian I am hopeful that Jonathan’s message will be heard in homes, coffee shops, and churches where hurting is real.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="endorsement">
				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;<strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> is a journey in both the agony of abandonment and the joy of finding true healing in the saving work of Jesus Christ.  Jonathan Edwards writes with a compelling and fresh style that draws the reader into the rawness of emotions and the intricacies of the movements of the heart through one of the most painful trials a person can experience—being left by a parent.  This book will be a profound help to all who read it—both those who need the same kind of healing that God has worked in Jonathan’s heart, and those who yearn to show compassion to others in that same situation.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="endorsement">
				<p class="endorsement-quote">&#8220;In <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>, Jonathan Edwards does something that is hard to do; take us through the storm of divorce and abandonment, show us the ugly aftermath, and carry us into the hope of a bright tomorrow that only Christ can bring. To get there, Jonathan must tear into some old wounds for our benefit and for the benefit for those yet to travel this lonely, often puzzling journey. Out of the stark reality of brokenness comes hope and out of the despair of a difficult past comes a future of promise. If you have been on this road or know someone currently walking it, LEFT is both a reminder of the destruction we can bring to each other and the promise that those scars can become markers toward a joyful next step.&#8221;</p>
